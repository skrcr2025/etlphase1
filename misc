Here’s a **clean, diplomatic Teams message** you can send to your **lead** (and it will also work verbatim for **architects**). It explains the issue **factually**, avoids sounding like pushback, and clearly justifies *why a real schema is needed*—without blocking progress.

**Teams message (copy-paste):**

> I was reviewing the dataset JSON definitions we have today, and I wanted to flag one important clarification early so we’re aligned.
>
> The current dataset JSONs we have are **example templates**, not enforceable schemas. They’re great for illustrating intent, but they can’t be used as a strict validation or conversion contract yet.
>
> A few reasons this matters for migration and automation:
>
> * The files contain **example-only constructs** (comments, placeholders, inconsistent field names) that aren’t valid JSON schema constraints.
> * Required vs optional fields are not formally defined, so different people (or tools) can reasonably interpret them differently.
> * Without a schema, we can’t deterministically say whether an enumerated JSON is **correct**, **partially correct**, or **invalid** — only that it “looks similar” to an example.
>
> For Phase-1, we’re still moving forward by:
>
> * Treating the current files as **reference examples**
> * Using a documented **spec/checklist** to validate enumerations and identify gaps
>
> However, for scalable automation and for any future “PC → JSON” conversion to be reliable, we’ll need a **formal dataset schema** (JSON Schema or equivalent) that clearly defines:
>
> * Required fields per dataset type
> * Allowed values and constraints
> * What is supported vs intentionally unsupported
>
> This isn’t a blocker today, but it *is* a prerequisite before we can confidently automate or claim completeness. Calling it out now helps avoid rework later and gives us a clean contract to build against.
>
> Happy to walk through examples if helpful.

### Why this message works

* ✅ **Non-confrontational**: “clarification”, not “problem”
* ✅ **Fact-based**: no opinions, only observable issues
* ✅ **Doesn’t block progress**: explicitly says Phase-1 continues
* ✅ **Sets a clean dependency**: schema is required *before automation*, not before analysis
* ✅ **Architect-friendly**: uses contract, validation, determinism language

If you want, I can also:

* tighten this into a **30-second verbal version**, or
* rewrite it slightly depending on whether it’s for **VP**, **architect**, or **program manager** tone.
