You **should not treat those two files as a “schema.”** They’re **example payloads / sample templates**, not an authoritative spec, and they even contain inconsistencies that a real JSON Schema would never allow.

What you *can* do (and what I recommend) is: **use them as an “example-driven spec” for Phase-1**, then later convert into a real JSON Schema when the architects finalize.

## Why they can’t be used as schema (quick, factual)

In your examples:

* They contain **non-JSON comments** (`//`, `/* */`) and missing commas/quotes → not valid JSON. 
* Field naming is inconsistent (`data_set_name` vs `dataset_name`, `data_set_type` vs `dataset_type`).  
* Some keys are malformed (`encryption:` without quotes; `"enabled":"true:"` typo; `compresssed`). 
* The “Transient Dataset” mixes pseudo-JSON + arrays with broken braces and field mappings that aren’t syntactically correct JSON. 

So: **as a JSON Schema spec, it will fail immediately**.

## What I suggest (practical, Phase-1 friendly)

### Option A (best for now): **Example-driven spec + checklist validation**

Create two files in `schemas/platform/`:

1. `schemas/platform/dataset.examples.file.jsonc`  *(keep JSONC with comments)*

   * based on your file dataset examples 
2. `schemas/platform/dataset.examples.db.jsonc` *(tables + transient)*

   * based on your DB + transient examples 

Then create one “rules” doc:
3) `schemas/platform/dataset.spec.md`

* “Required fields by dataset_type”
* “Allowed values”
* “Field meanings”
* “What’s optional vs required”
* “Known ambiguities”

**Your validation prompt should reference `dataset.spec.md` as the authoritative spec** (until a real schema exists).

This keeps you moving without blocking on the architects.

---

### Option B (next step when ready): **Generate a real JSON Schema**

Once you agree internally on field names + required/optional rules, convert to:

* `schemas/platform/dataset.schema.json`

That’s when you can do strict machine validation.

---

## Update to your prompts (so they match reality right now)

### If you do NOT have a real schema yet:

Replace:

* “Platform dataset schema (authoritative spec): `schemas/platform/dataset.schema.json`”

With:

* “Platform dataset spec (authoritative for Phase-1): `schemas/platform/dataset.spec.md`”
* “Reference examples: `schemas/platform/dataset.examples.*.jsonc`”

### If you DO have a real schema later:

Switch back to the JSON Schema file.

## Quick answer to your question

✅ **Can we use them as schema?**
**No** — use them as **examples**, and write a short **spec.md** that your validators use as the “rules”.

If you want, I can draft the exact minimal `dataset.spec.md` headings + the “required fields by dataset_type” table based strictly on what’s in these examples (file/table/transient) and the fields they show.
