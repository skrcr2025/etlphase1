You are validating a PLATFORM DATASET JSON enumerated from an Informatica PowerCenter mapping.

Inputs I will provide:
- PowerCenter mapping XML (or extracted intent summary)
- Enumerated Dataset JSON:
  validations/workflows/<WF_NAME>/enumerated_json/dataset.json
- Platform dataset schema (authoritative spec):
  schemas/platform/dataset.schema.json
- Baseline enumeration assumptions (mandatory defaults):
  templates/enumeration_assumptions_baseline.md
- Workflow-specific enumeration assumptions (mandatory overrides):
  validations/workflows/<WF_NAME>/enumeration_assumptions.md

Assumption Handling Rules (MANDATORY):
- Treat baseline assumptions as default rules.
- Treat workflow-specific assumptions as overrides or clarifications.
- Do NOT invent new assumptions.
- If intent cannot be resolved using the provided assumptions, flag it as a GAP.

Tasks:
1) Infer the intended dataset behavior from PowerCenter:
   - source vs target role
   - table vs SQL vs file semantics
   - filters, joins, projections, aggregation intent (if present)
2) Validate the enumerated Dataset JSON against the platform schema:
   - required fields present?
   - values conform to schema constraints?
   - defaults explicitly specified vs assumed?
3) Determine representability:
   - fully representable by schema
   - partially representable (requires assumptions)
   - not representable (schema limitation)
4) Identify enumeration issues:
   - semantically incorrect fields
   - missing required fields
   - contradictions with PowerCenter intent
5) Produce a structured gap analysis:
   - Blocking gaps (cannot deploy / invalid schema)
   - High-risk gaps (deployable but incorrect semantics)
   - Medium-risk gaps
6) Output:
   - Dataset validation status: PASS / PARTIAL / FAIL
   - Gap table with severity and rationale
   - Assumptions applied (explicit references)
   - Open questions (if assumptions insufficient)

Constraints:
- Do NOT rewrite or fix the JSON
- Do NOT assume platform defaults unless explicitly stated in schema or assumptions
- Be strict, schema-driven, and assumption-bound
