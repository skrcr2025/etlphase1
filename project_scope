Migration Analysis

Key Concepts:

Baseline Assumptions
Baseline assumptions define global rules used during enumeration.
These assumptions are captured once and apply across all workflows.
They represent interpretive boundaries, not execution guarantees.

Workflow-Specific Assumptions (Delta)
Each workflow may require additional assumptions beyond the baseline.
These are captured as delta-only assumptions for that workflow.
If no deviations exist, this is explicitly stated.

Validation & Gap Analysis
Gap and ambiguity identification is an output of validation.


Validation Process (Per Workflow)
- Enumerate platform JSONs from PowerCenter artifacts (best-effort)
- Validate enumerations against PowerCenter intent + platform schema
- Capture assumptions, unknowns, and gaps as outputs of validation
- This is not a commitment that enumerated JSONs will execute correctly on the platform.


Inputs Required (Per Workflow)

Each workflow validation requires the following inputs:
- PowerCenter Workflow XML
- PowerCenter Mapping XML(s)
- Enumerated platform JSONs:
- dataset.json
- pipeline.json
- Platform JSON schema definitions (reference only)
- Baseline assumptions file:
- templates/enumeration_assumptions_baseline.md

Step 1: Confirm Baseline Assumptions

Review the baseline assumptions file.
Treat these as global truth for enumeration.
Do not modify the baseline during workflow validation.

Step 2: Generate Workflow-Specific Assumptions (Delta)

Use the delta-only assumptions prompt to generate:
enumeration_assumptions.md
This file must contain only:
Deviations from baseline assumptions
Additional assumptions required for this workflow
Unknowns requiring confirmation
If no deviations exist, explicitly state that none were identified.

Step 3: Dataset JSON Validation

Use the dataset validation prompt to:
Compare PowerCenter source/target intent to dataset.json
Validate schema alignment and expressiveness
Identify:
Missing constructs
Simplifications
Unsupported patterns
Assumptions applied

Output:
validation/dataset_validation.md

Step 4: Pipeline JSON Validation

Use the pipeline validation prompt to:
Compare PowerCenter workflow execution intent to pipeline.json
Validate task structure, dependencies, and mapping expressiveness

Identify:
Dependency loss
Conditional logic gaps
Execution ambiguities
Platform constraints

Output:
validation/pipeline_validation.md



Outcomes

For each workflow, this process produces:
Enumerated platform JSONs
Explicit assumption documentation
Structured validation results

Clear visibility into:
What is representable
What is ambiguous
What is unsupported
What requires manual handling
These outputs collectively inform next-step decisions.

Important Note

This process is intentionally iterative.
Findings from validation may lead to:
Refinement of assumptions
Adjustment of enumeration strategy
Re-evaluation of automation scope
