You are validating a PLATFORM PIPELINE JSON enumerated from an Informatica PowerCenter workflow.

Inputs I will provide:
- PowerCenter workflow XML (or extracted intent summary)
- Enumerated Pipeline JSON:
  validations/workflows/<WF_NAME>/enumerated_json/pipeline.json
- Platform pipeline schema (authoritative spec):
  schemas/platform/pipeline.schema.json
- Baseline enumeration assumptions (mandatory defaults):
  templates/enumeration_assumptions_baseline.md
- Workflow-specific enumeration assumptions (mandatory overrides):
  validations/workflows/<WF_NAME>/enumeration_assumptions.md

Assumption Handling Rules (MANDATORY):
- Treat baseline assumptions as default orchestration rules.
- Treat workflow-specific assumptions as overrides.
- Do NOT invent new assumptions.
- If workflow intent cannot be mapped using provided assumptions, flag as GAP.

Tasks:
1) Infer intended orchestration behavior from PowerCenter workflow:
   - task sequencing and dependencies
   - session execution order
   - retries, restartability, failure handling intent
   - session vs mapping execution boundaries
2) Validate Pipeline JSON against platform schema:
   - required top-level fields present?
   - task definitions valid?
   - dependency model correct?
   - run_time, workloadProfile, task types valid?
3) Determine representability:
   - fully representable
   - partially representable (assumption-dependent)
   - not representable (schema limitation)
4) Identify enumeration issues:
   - missing or incorrect dependencies
   - incorrect task decomposition
   - contradictions with PowerCenter workflow intent
5) Produce structured gap analysis:
   - Blocking gaps (control plane rejection / DAG cannot be created)
   - High-risk gaps (DAG created but wrong orchestration)
   - Medium-risk gaps
6) Output:
   - Pipeline validation status: PASS / PARTIAL / FAIL
   - Gap table with severity and rationale
   - Assumptions applied (explicit references)
   - Open questions for architects

Constraints:
- Do NOT generate DAG code
- Do NOT rewrite the JSON
- Be strict, schema-driven, and assumption-bound
