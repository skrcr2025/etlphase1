You are validating a PLATFORM PIPELINE JSON enumerated from an Informatica PowerCenter workflow.

Inputs I will provide:
- PowerCenter workflow XML (or extracted intent summary)
- Pipeline JSON (as enumerated)
- Pipeline JSON template/spec (platform design)

Tasks:
1) Infer the intended orchestration behavior from PowerCenter workflow:
   - task sequencing / dependencies
   - retries, restartability, failure handling intent
   - session/mapping execution boundaries
2) Validate the pipeline JSON against the platform template/spec:
   - required top-level fields present?
   - task structure correct?
   - dependency model valid?
   - workloadProfile/run_time/task types valid?
3) Determine what workflow semantics are representable vs not representable:
   - fully representable
   - partially representable (needs assumptions)
   - not representable (schema limitation)
4) Identify enumeration issues:
   - missing dependencies
   - incorrect task decomposition (too few/too many tasks)
   - fields that contradict PC workflow intent
5) Produce a structured gap report:
   - Blocking gaps (control plane rejection / cannot generate DAG)
   - High-risk gaps (DAG created but wrong orchestration)
   - Medium-risk gaps
   - Assumptions made
6) Output:
   - Pipeline validation status: PASS / PARTIAL / FAIL
   - Gap table with severity + rationale
   - Assumptions list
   - Open questions to confirm with architects (if needed)

Constraints:
- Do NOT generate DAG code
- Do NOT rewrite the JSON
- Be strict and schema-driven
