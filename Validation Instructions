PowerCenter → Platform JSON Enumeration + Validation (Migration Analysis)

Important Usage Rule (Read First):
All Copilot prompts are responsible for creating and writing output files directly.
Team members must not manually copy outputs into files unless explicitly instructed.

If a prompt specifies a file path, Copilot must write the content to that file.

1) Folder Setup (Once)

Ensure the following structure exists before running any prompts:

migration-validation/
├── schemas/platform/
├── templates/
├── prompts/
├── instructions/
└── validations/workflows/<WF_NAME>/

Each workflow folder must contain:

validations/workflows/<WF_NAME>/
├── input/
├── enumerated_json/
├── validation/
└── summary.md

2) Inputs Required (Per Workflow)

Place these files manually before running any prompt:

Required
input/workflow.xml
input/mappings/*.xml
enumerated_json/dataset.json
enumerated_json/pipeline.json

Reference Files (already present)
templates/enumeration_assumptions_baseline.md
schemas/platform/*.schema.json

3) Step-by-Step Execution (Exact Order)
Step 1 — Manual Enumeration (Human step)

Team manually creates:

enumerated_json/
├── dataset.json
└── pipeline.json


Using:
PowerCenter XMLs
Platform JSON schemas
Baseline assumptions

No Copilot prompt is used in this step.

Step 2 — Generate Workflow-Specific Assumptions (Delta-Only)
Purpose: Capture only deviations, extra assumptions, and unknowns.

Prompt to use:
prompts/generate_delta_assumptions.prompt.md

Copilot behavior:
Reads baseline assumptions
Analyzes WF XML, Mapping XML, enumerated JSONs
Writes output directly to:
validations/workflows/<WF_NAME>/enumeration_assumptions.md

Team action:
Run the prompt
Review the generated file
Do NOT manually rewrite it

Step 3 — Dataset JSON Validation
Purpose: Validate dataset.json against PowerCenter mapping intent and platform schema.

Prompt to use:
prompts/validate_dataset_json.prompt.md

Copilot behavior:
Compares mapping XML + dataset.json
Identifies expressiveness limits, gaps, assumptions
Writes output directly to:
validations/workflows/<WF_NAME>/validation/dataset_validation.md

Team action:
Run the prompt
Review the generated file
Do NOT copy/paste output manually

Step 4 — Pipeline JSON Validation
Purpose: Validate pipeline.json against workflow execution intent and platform schema.

Prompt to use:
prompts/validate_pipeline_json.prompt.md

Copilot behavior:
Compares workflow XML + pipeline.json
Validates task order, dependencies, mappings
Writes output directly to:
validations/workflows/<WF_NAME>/validation/pipeline_validation.md

Team action:
Run the prompt
Review the generated file

Step 5 — Optional Cross-Object Consistency Check
Purpose: Validate wiring consistency between dataset.json and pipeline.json.

Prompt to use:
prompts/combined_crosscheck.prompt.md

Copilot behavior:
Cross-checks dataset references, aliases, connections
Writes output directly to:
validations/workflows/<WF_NAME>/validation/combined_crosscheck.md
