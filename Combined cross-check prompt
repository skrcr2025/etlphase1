Cross-check ONLY reference integrity between the enumerated Dataset JSON(s) and Pipeline JSON.

Inputs:
- Pipeline JSON
- Dataset JSON(s)
- Connection/Datastore names available (resolved list)

Tasks:
1) Verify pipeline references:
   - dataset names exist and match exactly
   - connection names exist and match exactly
   - aliases are consistent
2) Validate mapping references:
   - fields/columns referenced in pipeline mapping exist in dataset definition (if fields are provided)
3) List only cross-object issues:
   - missing references
   - naming mismatches
   - incompatible dataset type vs task type
Output:
- Cross-check status: PASS / PARTIAL / FAIL
- Reference issues list with severity and fix hints
Constraints:
- Do NOT repeat dataset-only or pipeline-only issues already covered
